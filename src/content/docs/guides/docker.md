```docker
version: "3.1"

services:
  peppermint_postgres:
    container_name: peppermint_postgres
    image: postgres:latest
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: peppermint
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: 1234
      POSTGRES_DB: peppermint

  peppermint:
    container_name: peppermint
    image: pepperlabs/peppermint:latest
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
      - 5003:5003
    restart: always
    depends_on:
      - peppermint_postgres
    environment:
      DB_USERNAME: "peppermint"
      DB_PASSWORD: "1234"
      DB_HOST: "peppermint_postgres"
      SECRET: 'peppermint4life'

```
### üñ•Ô∏è Step 2: Launch the Peppermint Containers

Once the `docker-compose.yml` file is set up, run the following command to start the containers:
